TelemetryRadio
==============

A radio transmission and receiver system for KSP.

This mod consists of three primary components:
TelemetryRadio - A framework for transmitting and receiving radio signals
DataRecorder - A mod that records flight data and transmits it en masse when there is a connection
GSLib - A support library, derived from a library of mine located at: https://github.com/gridersoftware/GSLib.
		This library is modified to be minimalized and to work with KSP.
